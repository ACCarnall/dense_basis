dense_basis: SED fitting with smooth nonparametric star formation histories
===========================================================================

dense_basis is an implementation of the Dense Basis method tailored to SED fitting, in particular, the task of recovering accurate star formation history (SFH) information from galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The current code is being adapted from its original use-case (simultaneously fitting specific large catalogs of galaxies) to being a general purpose SED fitting code and acting as a module to compress and decompress SFHs.

The code is designed to be intuitive to use, and and consists of three steps to get you started:

- defining your priors
- generating a model atlas (params <-> SEDs) to use while fitting
- actually fitting your data and visualizing the posteriors

A more detailed description can be found [here](usage/getting_started). 
    
If you are interested in going off the beaten track and trying different things, please let me know so that I can help you run the code as you'd like!



Features
--------

- GP-SFH module
- Prior atlas generator - trade space for time complexity
- SED fitter module


Dependencies
------------

- FSPS (installed in fortran, with the correct $SPS_HOME variable)
- python-fsps (v.0.3.0+, installed in conjunction with FSPS)
- george (v.0.3.1+)
- sklearn (v.0.21.2+)
- astropy (v.3.2.1+)
- numpy, scipy and matplotlib
- python 3.x


Installation
------------

Ideally, you should be able to install `dense_basis` by running:

    pip install dense_basis
    
Make sure that you have the dependencies installed before you try this, though.
