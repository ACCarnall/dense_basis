# Dense Basis SED fitting

An implementation of the Dense Basis method tailored to SED fitting, in particular, the task of recovering accurate star formation history (SFH) information from galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The current code is being adapted from its original use-case (simultaneously fitting specific large catalogs of galaxies) to being a general purpose SED fitting code and acting as a module to compress and decompress SFHs. 

As such, it is currently in an `alpha` phase, where modules are being built and crash-tested and documenation is being written. If you are interested in testing or contributing to the repository, please shoot me an email.
